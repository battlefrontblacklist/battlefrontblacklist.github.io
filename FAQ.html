                                People can be blacklisted for a variety of reasons that ultimately depend on the nature of the relationship between the organization compiling the blacklist and the blacklisted entity. Regardless of the specific reason for blacklisting, the ultimate purpose
                                is to restrict future interactions between the blacklisted individual and the organization.

                                People who are blacklisted are those who hack the game, are toxic players, etc. I don't include in the list those who are "stronger than me and kill me".
